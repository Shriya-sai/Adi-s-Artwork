            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am Aditya Rao. I am currently studying in GIIS school in Singapore. </p>
            <p>In this website, I share with the world my passion for Art. </p>
            <p>My passion for art probably began when I was just 3 and now, I go to art classes every week. I look forward to these classes every week! 
                I am passionate about art and painting as the mere sight of the splatter of colours fills me up with joy. What started as just a cure for my boredom has now become the very medium through which I express my creativity. 
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, Photography is also very close to my heart as it provides me with a medium with which I can capture heart warming moments that brings me joy. 
            </p>
            <p> Although Iâ€™m not the best at, I still enjoy cooking. I often help out in the kitchen by chopping vegetables. Ocasionally, I try some easy recipies off of the internet.</p>
